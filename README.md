# Nowell

This project begins in 2008/12/28

Nowell is an open-source homebrew for the Drunken Coders Winter Compo, it's a 2D shoot-em-up vertical scrolling. I use SDL interface to handle graphics and wiimote.

Latest binary and source are available at : binary and source

Some websites put Dovoto as submitter and coder, but it's wrong, Dovoto has nothing to do with this game.
